_**Assistant**_

I'll help you initialize this repository for an isobutane canister calculator. First, let's create the essential files and set up the project structure. Since this is a new project, I'll first create the Memory Bank files to maintain proper documentation.

Let me first create a basic project structure with documentation:

---

_****_

```bash
mkdir -p docs src tests
```

```
⋊> ~/w/A/M/D/G/isobutane-canister-calculator on main ⨯ 

```

---

_****_



Now, I'll create the Memory Bank files and essential project files:

+ # Isobutane Canister Calculator - Product Context
+ 
+ ## Purpose
+ The Isobutane Canister Calculator is a tool designed to help outdoor enthusiasts and campers calculate the remaining fuel in their isobutane canisters. This solves the common problem of uncertainty around remaining fuel levels in partially used canisters.
+ 
+ ## Problems Solved
+ 1. Accurate fuel estimation in partially used canisters
+ 2. Better trip planning by knowing exact fuel amounts
+ 3. Waste reduction by maximizing canister usage
+ 4. Safety improvement through better fuel management
+ 
+ ## How It Should Work
+ 1. Users input the:
+    - Initial canister weight (from manufacturer)
+    - Empty canister weight (from manufacturer)
+    - Current canister weight (measured)
+ 2. The calculator should:
+    - Calculate remaining fuel amount
+    - Show percentage of fuel remaining
+    - Estimate burn time based on common stove types
+    - Provide visual representation of remaining fuel
+ 
+ ## Target Users
+ - Backpackers
+ - Campers
+ - Outdoor cooking enthusiasts
+ - Emergency preparedness planners 
```

+ # System Patterns and Architecture
+ 
+ ## Architecture Overview
+ The application will follow a simple, modular architecture:
+ 
+ ```
+ isobutane-canister-calculator/
+ ├── src/                    # Source code
+ │   ├── calculator/         # Core calculation logic
+ │   ├── ui/                 # User interface components
+ │   └── utils/             # Utility functions
+ ├── tests/                  # Test files
+ └── docs/                   # Documentation
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Key Technical Decisions
+ 1. Web-based implementation for maximum accessibility
+ 2. Client-side calculations for privacy and offline use
+ 3. Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
+ 4. Unit testing for calculation accuracy
+ 
+ ## Design Patterns
+ - Module Pattern for code organization
+ - Factory Pattern for creating calculation instances
+ - Observer Pattern for UI updates
+ - Strategy Pattern for different calculation methods
+ 
+ ## Code Style
+ - ES6+ JavaScript standards
+ - Clear function and variable naming
+ - Comprehensive error handling
+ - Detailed code comments
+ - TypeScript for type safety 
```

```diff
- 
+ # Technical Context
+ 
+ ## Technology Stack
+ - TypeScript for type-safe development
+ - React for user interface
+ - Jest for testing
+ - Vite for build tooling
+ - GitHub Pages for deployment
+ 
+ ## Development Setup
+ 1. Node.js (v18+)
+ 2. npm or yarn package manager
+ 3. Git for version control
+ 4. VS Code (recommended IDE)
+ 
+ ## Development Commands
+ ```bash
+ npm install          # Install dependencies
+ npm run dev         # Start development server
+ npm run test        # Run tests
+ npm run build       # Build for production
+ npm run deploy      # Deploy to GitHub Pages
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Technical Constraints
+ - Browser compatibility: Latest 2 versions of major browsers
+ - Mobile-first responsive design
+ - Offline functionality
+ - No backend required - all calculations client-side
+ - Lightweight bundle size
+ 
+ ## Dependencies
+ Core:
+ - react
+ - typescript
+ - vite
+ 
+ Development:
+ - jest
+ - @testing-library/react
+ - eslint
+ - prettier 
```

I've completed the repository initialization with the following:

1. Created Memory Bank documentation in the `docs/` directory:
   - `productContext.md`: Defines the purpose and functionality of the calculator
   - `activeContext.md`: Current development status and next steps
   - `systemPatterns.md`: Technical architecture and patterns
   - `techContext.md`: Development setup and dependencies
   - `progress.md`: Project progress tracking

2. Set up basic project structure:
   - Created `src/`, `tests/`, and `docs/` directories
   - Added `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions
   - Added `LICENSE` file with MIT license
   - Added `.gitignore` for Node.js project

3. Initialized git repository:
   - Created initial commit with documentation
   - Set up remote repository
   - Pushed to GitHub

The repository is now ready for development. The next steps would be to:

1. Set up the development environment with React and TypeScript
2. Create the core calculation logic
3. Develop the user interface
4. Add tests

Would you like me to proceed with any of these next steps?
