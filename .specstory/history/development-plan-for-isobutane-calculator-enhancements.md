## Development Plan for Isobutane Calculator Enhancements (2/5/2025, 5:08:15 PM)

_**User**_

Here's how you could implement those features for the isobutane calculator:

1. Barcode Scanning:
- Use `react-zbar-wasm` library for barcode scanning
- It supports UPC, EAN, and other standard barcode formats
- You could maintain a database mapping barcodes to specific canister types
- Add a camera button that opens the scanner overlay
- When a barcode is detected, automatically select the correct canister type

2. PWA (Progressive Web App):
- Create a `manifest.json` with app details
- Add necessary icons for different sizes
- Implement a service worker for offline functionality
- Cache static assets and data
- Configure for "Add to Home Screen" functionality
- Basic setup steps:
  ```json
  // manifest.json
  {
    "name": "Isobutane Calculator",
    "short_name": "IsoCalc",
    "start_url": "/",
    "display": "standalone",
    "theme_color": "#f97316", // Orange
    "background_color": "#ffffff"
  }
  ```

3. Camera App Integration:
- Use the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API
- Add a camera component:
  ```javascript
  const CameraComponent = () => {
    // Access camera
    // Show video preview
    // Take photo of scale reading
    // Use OCR to read the weight
  }
  ```
- Consider using Tesseract.js for OCR to read digital scale displays
- Could also use TensorFlow.js for digit recognition from scale displays

4. Integration Flow:
```
User Flow:
1. Open app → Click camera icon
2. Options appear:
   - Scan barcode (auto-selects canister)
   - Take photo of scale (auto-inputs weight)
3. Results update automatically
```

Would you like me to explain any of these aspects in more detail? I can provide more specific implementation guidance for any part you're interested in.

# Development Plan: Enhancing the Isobutane Canister Calculator

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to extend the current isobutane calculator (implemented in React and TypeScript) with the following features:
- **Barcode Scanning:** Automatically select the correct canister type by scanning barcodes.
- **PWA (Progressive Web App):** Enable offline functionality with service workers and allow app installation.
- **Camera Integration for OCR:** Capture images of scale readings to automatically extract the current weight.

The goal is to provide a seamless user experience by integrating these features while maintaining the existing modular structure and calculation logic.

## 1. Project Environment & Preparation
- **Review the Current Codebase:**
  - Ensure the core logic in `src/isobutane.tsx` is stable.
  - Verify that Memory Bank documentation (e.g., `docs/productContext.md`, `docs/activeContext.md`, `docs/systemPatterns.md`, `docs/techContext.md`, and `docs/progress.md`) is up-to-date.
- **Dependencies & Tools:**
  - Confirm React, TypeScript, and Vite are properly configured.
  - Add new dependencies:
    - `react-zbar-wasm` for barcode scanning.
    - `tesseract.js` (or an alternative OCR solution such as TensorFlow.js for digit recognition) for processing scale images.
    - A PWA plugin (like `vite-plugin-pwa`) to automate service worker creation and asset caching.
- **Project Structure:**
  - Continue using the current structure:
    ```
    isobutane-canister-calculator/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── calculator/         # Core calculation logic
    │   ├── ui/                 # User interface components
    │   └── utils/              # Utility functions
    ├── tests/                  # Test suites
    └── docs/                   # Documentation
    ```
  - Update the docs folder with this development plan.

## 2. Feature Implementation

### 2.1 Barcode Scanning Integration
- **Objective:** Enable users to scan a barcode so the app can auto-select the correct canister type.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Integrate Library:**  
    - Install `react-zbar-wasm` and test its compatibility.
  - **Create Barcode Scanner Component:**  
    - Develop a component (`src/ui/BarcodeScanner.tsx`) that opens a camera overlay for scanning.
    - Configure it to detect standard formats like UPC and EAN.
    - Once a barcode is detected, map the result to a defined canister type (this mapping could be maintained in a new JSON file or integrated with existing data).
  - **UI Integration:**
    - Add a camera icon or button on the main calculator component (in `src/isobutane.tsx`).
    - When clicked, launch the barcode scanner overlay.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Provide appropriate feedback if a scan fails or the barcode is unrecognized.

### 2.2 PWA (Progressive Web App) Integration
- **Objective:** Make the app installable and operable offline.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Manifest File:**
    - Create a `manifest.json` file with details such as app name, short name, icons, start URL, display mode, theme color, and background color.
  - **Service Worker:**
    - Implement a service worker using Workbox or a Vite PWA plugin to cache static assets and serve content offline.
  - **PWA Testing:**
    - Validate “Add to Home Screen” functionality and test offline behavior on multiple browsers and devices.
  - **Sample `manifest.json`:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Isobutane Calculator",
      "short_name": "IsoCalc",
      "start_url": "/",
      "display": "standalone",
      "theme_color": "#f97316",
      "background_color": "#ffffff",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
          "sizes": "192x192",
          "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
          "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png",
          "sizes": "512x512",
          "type": "image/png"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### 2.3 Camera App Integration for OCR
- **Objective:** Allow users to capture an image of a scale and automatically extract the weighted value.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Create Camera Component:**
    - Develop a new component (`src/ui/CameraComponent.tsx`) that utilizes the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API to access the camera.
    - Provide a live video preview with an option to capture a photo.
  - **Implement OCR Functionality:**
    - Integrate `tesseract.js` (or TensorFlow.js) to perform OCR on the captured image.
    - Process the image to extract numerical values representing weight.
    - On successful extraction, automatically populate the weight input field in `src/isobutane.tsx`.
  - **Handle Permissions & Errors:**
    - Manage camera permissions and display instructions or error messages if access is denied.

## 3. Integration Flow & UI Enhancements
- **User Journey:**
  1. **Entry Point:** User opens the app and sees the main calculator.
  2. **Options:**  
     - Click the camera icon to choose either barcode scanning or image capture for weight.
  3. **Execution:**  
     - For barcode scanning, the scanner overlay appears and records a barcode, auto-selecting the corresponding canister.
     - For camera capture, the app uses OCR to read the displayed weight and updates the input automatically.
  4. **Result:**  
     - The calculator updates the fuel percentage and remaining fuel values based on the selected canister and weight input.
- **Design Considerations:**
  - Ensure consistency with existing UI elements (e.g., use the same styling as in `isobutane.tsx`).
  - Provide clear visual feedback during scanning, capturing, and OCR processing.
  - Maintain responsiveness and accessibility across devices.

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write tests for each new component (BarcodeScanner and CameraComponent).
  - Validate utility functions for OCR and image processing.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Ensure that scanning or OCR correctly updates the state in the main calculator.
- **PWA Testing:**
  - Test service worker registration, caching mechanisms, and offline functionality.
  - Validate “Add to Home Screen” behavior on various devices.
- **Manual QA:**
  - Perform cross-device testing (mobile and desktop).
  - Gather user feedback on camera permissions and accuracy of OCR and barcode scanning.

## 5. Deployment & Documentation
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update the README.md with new feature descriptions and usage instructions.
  - Revise Memory Bank documentation (e.g., `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect the new integrations.
- **Deployment:**
  - Integrate PWA assets into the build and deployment pipeline.
  - Deploy the updated application (e.g., via GitHub Pages) to a staging environment for final testing.
  - Monitor production deployments for any issues and iterate as necessary.

## 6. Milestones & Timeline
1. **Milestone 1: Environment Setup & Baseline Stabilization (1 week)**
   - Verify existing functionality and integrate new dependencies.
2. **Milestone 2: Feature Prototyping (2 weeks)**
   - Develop early prototypes for barcode scanning and camera OCR components.
3. **Milestone 3: Full Feature Integration (3 weeks)**
   - Complete and integrate barcode scanning, PWA, and camera OCR features.
4. **Milestone 4: Testing & QA (1–2 weeks)**
   - Conduct unit, integration, and manual tests across devices.
5. **Milestone 5: Deployment & Documentation (1 week)**
   - Finalize documentation updates and deploy to production.

## 7. Next Steps
- Create separate branches for each major feature (barcode, PWA, camera).
- Begin developing prototypes for individual components and iteratively integrate them into the main app.
- Update the Memory Bank documentation with any new decisions or progress details as the work advances.

# Development Plan: Isobutane Calculator MVP Enhancements

## Overview
This plan defines a minimal path to integrate a few key enhancements into the current isobutane calculator:
- **Barcode Scanning:** Auto-select canister types via barcode.
- **PWA Features:** Enable offline capability and allow installation.
- **Camera & OCR Integration:** Capture an image of the scale and extract weight.

## 1. Environment & Setup
- Verify the existing React, TypeScript, and Vite setup is working.
- Install additional dependencies:
  - `react-zbar-wasm` for barcode scanning.
  - `tesseract.js` for OCR.
  - `vite-plugin-pwa` for PWA integration.
- Maintain the project structure:
  ```
  isobutane-canister-calculator/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── calculator/       # Core calculation logic
  │   ├── ui/               # UI components (BarcodeScanner, CameraComponent, etc.)
  │   └── utils/            # Helpers and utilities
  ├── docs/                # Documentation (including this plan)
  └── package.json
  ```

## 2. Feature Implementations

### 2.1 Barcode Scanning
- Install and integrate the `react-zbar-wasm` package.
- Create a new component at `src/ui/BarcodeScanner.tsx` that:
  - Opens a camera overlay for scanning.
  - Recognizes standard barcode formats (UPC, EAN, etc.).
  - Maps the detected barcode to its corresponding canister type.

### 2.2 PWA Integration
- Create a `manifest.json` in the public folder with basic app details:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Isobutane Calculator",
    "short_name": "IsoCalc",
    "start_url": "/",
    "display": "standalone",
    "theme_color": "#f97316",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "icons": [
      {
        "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
        "sizes": "192x192",
        "type": "image/png"
      },
      {
        "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png",
        "sizes": "512x512",
        "type": "image/png"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Use the `vite-plugin-pwa` to register a service worker that:
  - Caches static assets.
  - Enables offline functionality.

### 2.3 Camera & OCR Integration
- Develop a new component `src/ui/CameraComponent.tsx`:
  - Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` to access the device camera.
  - Provide a live preview and the ability to capture a photo.
  - Process the image with `tesseract.js` to extract the displayed weight.
  - Automatically update the weight input on the main calculator.

## 3. Integration & UI Flow
- Modify the main calculator (`src/isobutane.tsx`) by adding:
  - A camera icon or button.
  - An option for users to choose between barcode scanning and camera capture.
- When a barcode is scanned or the OCR successfully reads a weight:
  - Auto-fill the related input fields.
  - Recalculate fuel remaining based on the input.

## 4. Minimal QA (Manual Testing Only)
- Verify the basic functionality by manually testing:
  - Barcode scanning properly selects a canister type.
  - The camera component captures an image and OCR extracts a valid weight.
  - PWA functionality (installation prompt and offline capability) works as expected.

## 5. Next Steps
- Merge the new components into your existing codebase.
- Run the application using `npm run dev` and perform manual checks.
- Iterate based on early user feedback and refine as needed.
```

This streamlined plan should serve well for an MVP without extra overhead for unit tests or detailed QA process. Enjoy building your MVP!
