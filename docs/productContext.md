The Isobutane Canister Calculator is a tool designed to help outdoor enthusiasts and campers calculate the remaining fuel in their isobutane canisters. This solves the common problem of uncertainty around remaining fuel levels in partially used canisters.

## Problems Solved
1. Accurate fuel estimation in partially used canisters
2. Better trip planning by knowing exact fuel amounts
3. Waste reduction by maximizing canister usage
4. Safety improvement through better fuel management

## How It Should Work
1. Users input the:
   - Initial canister weight (from manufacturer)
   - Empty canister weight (from manufacturer)
   - Current canister weight (measured)
2. The calculator should:
   - Calculate remaining fuel amount
   - Show percentage of fuel remaining
   - Estimate burn time based on common stove types
   - Provide visual representation of remaining fuel

## Target Users
- Backpackers
