### UI/UX
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Modern shadcn UI components
- [x] Loading states and error messages
- [x] Clear navigation
- [x] Intuitive layout

## In Progress
- [ ] Refining OCR accuracy for different scale displays
- [ ] Expanding barcode database with more canister models
- [ ] Adding support for more canister brands and models

## Planned Features
- [ ] Save frequently used canisters
- [ ] History of weight measurements
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] PWA implementation
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Known Issues
- OCR may struggle with certain scale displays
- Limited barcode database coverage
- Camera access may require multiple attempts on some devices

## Next Steps
1. Gather user feedback on OCR and barcode scanning accuracy
2. Expand barcode database with real canister barcodes
3. Implement data persistence for frequently used canisters
4. Add more comprehensive error recovery for camera access issues
